## Publications by Year

### 2025
- Yu, P., **Yoon, H.A.**, et al. Quantification of nonsense-free correlation uncovers the interaction between top-down and bottom-up sources of behavioral correlation in mouse V1. <span class="publication-venue">COSYNE 2025</span>  
  Plain-language: We separate behavior-driven vs. sensory-driven correlations to clarify what neural correlations actually communicate.

### 2024
- Yu, P., **Yoon, H.A.**, et al. Integration of behavioral related correlation from top-down and bottom-up pathways in mouse V1. <span class="publication-venue">COSYNE 2024</span>  
  Plain-language: How behavior and sensory inputs combine to shape measured correlations.
