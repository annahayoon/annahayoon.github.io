## Research Experience

### PhD Researcher
*UC Berkeley, Ji Lab | Berkeley, CA | 2020 - Present*
- Identified limitations in existing neuronal imaging analysis; led a multi-year project to develop a deep learning approach.
- Defined technical requirements for an imaging and analysis pipeline; implemented changes that improved temporal resolution in internal evaluations.

### Research Fellow
*Harvard Medical School, Wellman Center of Photomedicine | Boston, MA | 2019 - 2020*
- Spearheaded the development of a portable and low-cost optical coherence tomography (OCT) system, defining user needs and system specifications to make advanced medical imaging more accessible.
